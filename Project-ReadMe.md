## Final Project 

This web application serves as a reference tool for physical exercises, 
designed to help users explore and understand different workout techniques. 
Rather than tracking personal progress, the app focuses on providing clear descriptions, 
benefits, and proper execution tips for each exercise.

## Features

- Categorized exercise library (e.g., upper body, lower body, cardio, flexibility)
- Detailed descriptions including:
    - Target muscle groups
    - Step-by-step instructions
    - Common mistakes to avoid

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to create an accessible and informative resource for fitness enthusiasts, beginners, and instructors who want to better understand how each exercise works and how to perform it safely.
